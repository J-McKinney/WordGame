# WordGame:
My hang-man/word-guess-game, uses Javascript, html, and css files. I tried to clean it up as best as possible.
I did a lot of research online and used a bunch of examples that I read about. This took a good couple of
days to complete, including a couple of sleepless nights too. Thanks to a couple of sites that I viisted:
CSS Tricks, W3 School, Codecademy, and many more. More than I can remember lol...
