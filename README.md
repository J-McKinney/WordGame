# WordGame:
My hang-man/word-guess-game, uses Javascript, html, and css files. I tried to clean it up as best as possible.
I did a lot of research online and used a bunch of examples that I read about. This took a good couple of
days to complete, including a couple of sleepless nights too. Thanks to a couple of sites that I viisted:
CSS Tricks, W3 School, Codecademy, and many more. More than I can remember lol...

Start off by opening the link and when the screen opens, you're ready to play. Being a bartender, I decided to go with 
different types of vodka as your hint. I know back in my college days and I think it's safe to say for most college kids. 
We all had our fair share of drinking a lot of different types of liquor. I hope you were paying attention lol, probably not... If you guess the correct vodka or not, a winner/gameover pic will display and logged as a win. If you want to keep playing press any key to go again. It won't matter if you have a capital letter or not. The program will read it the same 
either way.
